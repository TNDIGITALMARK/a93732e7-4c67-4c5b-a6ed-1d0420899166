**Issue:** Git push wasn't working because upstream branch wasn't configured.
**Status:** ✅ FIXED - You can now push to GitHub!

## 📦 Deploy Your App NOW (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub ✅ (Already Working)

```bash
git push
```

### Step 2: Deploy to Vercel (2 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import:** Select your GitHub repository
3. **Deploy:** Click the deploy button

**That's it!** You'll get a live URL like `https://your-app.vercel.app`

### Step 3: Add Environment Variables (In Vercel Dashboard)

Copy these from your `.env` file into Vercel's environment variables section:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTROL_PLANE_API_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID
```

**Important:** Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTROL_PLANE_API_URL` to your production API URL (not localhost).

## ❓ What Was the Problem?

Your git repository's main branch didn't have an "upstream" configured. This meant git didn't know where to push your code.

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Now `git push` works perfectly! 🎉
