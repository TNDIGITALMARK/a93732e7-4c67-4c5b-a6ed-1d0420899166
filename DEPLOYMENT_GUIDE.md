## üöÄ Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel is the easiest way to deploy your Next.js application.

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Vercel:** https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import Git Repository**
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Connect your GitHub account if needed
   - Select repository: `TNDIGITALMARK/a93732e7-4c67-4c5b-a6ed-1d0420899166`
3. **Configure Project**
   - Project Name: Choose a name (or use auto-generated)
   - Framework Preset: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./` or `workspaces/container1` (depending on Vercel's detection)
4. **Environment Variables** (Important!)
   - Add these from your `.env` file:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://hfndfmtxhqvubnfiwzlz.supabase.co
     NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTROL_PLANE_API_URL=http://localhost:5001
     NEXT_PUBLIC_TENANT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
     NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
     ```
   - **Note:** Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTROL_PLANE_API_URL` to your production API URL
5. **Click "Deploy"**
   - Vercel will build and deploy automatically
   - You'll get a live URL like: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI (Advanced)

```bash
# Login to Vercel
npx vercel login

# Deploy (production)
npx vercel --prod

# Or deploy preview
npx vercel
```
